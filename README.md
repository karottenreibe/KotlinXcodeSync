# Kotlin Xcode Sync

Import kotlin files into an Xcode project. This is used in conjunction with the Xcode 
Kotlin plugin to allow for Kotlin/Native debugging in an iOS application.

Importing Kotlin files into Xcode is somewhat tricky to do manually. This plugin will facilitate
that.

It is called "Sync", but currently it will only add new files. Renamed or removed files will
need to be handled manually in Xcode.
